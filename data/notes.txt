Stability: 1 - Experimental. The feature is not subject to semantic versioning rules. Non-backward compatible changes or removal may occur in any future release. Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments.
Experimental features are subdivided into stages:

1.0 - Early development. Experimental features at this stage are unfinished and subject to substantial change.
1.1 - Active development. Experimental features at this stage are nearing minimum viability.
1.2 - Release candidate. Experimental features at this stage are hopefully ready to become stable. No further breaking changes are anticipated but may still occur in response to user feedback. We encourage user testing and feedback so that we can know that this feature is ready to be marked as stable.
